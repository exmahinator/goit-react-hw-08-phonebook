Hi everyone! I'm studying full stack at bootcamp, so currently have lack of experience but definitely will do my best to provide good-quality results.

In this task to register yourself - email name must be longer than 3 symbols and password must be more than 7 symbols with at least 1 uppercase letter, lovercase letter and digit. 

You can use fake emails because this project does not connected to any real databases and just exists to show the functionality and experience I've earned while studying. That's why it's "hw"
